              processing unit (CPU).It is a programmable multipurpose silicon chip, clock driven, register based, accepts binary data as
              input and provides output after processing it as per the instructions stored in the memory</p>

            Why we need a Microprocessor?
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p>A microprocessor is similar to our human brain, it can be trained to do anything.It can be programmed to do anything we want based on it’s instruction set and capabilities. Sometimes solutions are very complex, circuits also becomes very complex if we try to solve it without programming.Here is my analogy. Imagine you want to make a big building. Usage of BRICKS will make the construction process simple and cost effective.And it will also give you the freedom to make the building in shape and size what you like.Instruction set in a microprocessor are the bricks which you can use to solve your problem.By using those instructions you can easily solve complex program.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>A processor is the brain of a computer which basically consists of Arithmetical and Logical Unit (ALU), Control Unit and Register Array.As the name indicates ALU performs all arithmetic and logical operations on the data received from input devices or memory. Register array consists of a series of registers like accumulator (A), B, C, D etc. which acts as temporary fast access memory locations for processing data.As the name indicates, control unit controls the flow of instructions and data throughout the system.So basically a microprocessor takes input from input devices, process it as per instructions given in the memory and produces output.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><h4>Low caste</h4><p>Microprocessors are available at low cost due to integrated circuit technology. Which will reduce the cost of a computer system.</p></li>
              <li><h4>High speed</h4><p>Microprocessor chips can work at very high speed due to the technology involved in it. It is capable of executing millions of instructions per second.</p></li>
              <li><h4>Versatile</h4><p>Microprocessors are very versatile, the same chip can be used for a number of applications by simply changing the program (instructions stored in the memory).</p></li>
              <li><h4>Low Power Consumption</h4><p>microprocessors are usually manufactured using metal oxide semiconductor technology, in which MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) are working in saturation and cut off modes. 
              So the power consumption is very low compared to others.</p></li>

            <p>RISC is a type of microprocessor architecture which uses small, general purpose and highly optimized instruction set rather than more specialized set of instructions found in others.RISC offers high performance over its opposing architecture CISC (see below).In a processor, execution of each instruction require a special circuit to load and process the data. So by reducing instructions, the processor will be using simple circuits and faster in operation.</P>
